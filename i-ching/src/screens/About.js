            Back in the day, people would throw yarrow stalks.  More recently, people often toss coins.  With the results of the stalks or coins, you construct a Hexagram of broken and unbroken lines.  To use this app, all you need to do is press the <i>Divinate</i> button.
        </Card.Text>
            Each Hexagram is unique and has a number.  Feel free to google your Hexagram number to read more about it.
